## Future Enhancements

- Implement a caching mechanism to check if the user has previously logged in. If a valid session is found, users will be redirected directly to the home screen upon app launch, eliminating the need for repeated login until they choose to log out. This enhancement will improve user experience by providing seamless access to the app and reducing login friction.
